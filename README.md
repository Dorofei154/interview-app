### Features

1. **Real-Time Data Updates**:
   - Utilized **polling** to fetch the latest currency data at regular intervals.

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Applied typical React optimizations:
     - **`React.memo`**: To prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
     - **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`**: For memoization of expensive computations and stable functions.
     - **`React.Suspense`** and **lazy loading**: For dynamic component loading, reducing initial bundle size.

3. **Virtualized List**:
   - Implemented virtualized rendering for long lists, ensuring smooth scrolling and reduced DOM size, even with large datasets.

4. **Web Workers**:
   - Offloaded heavy computations like sorting and filtering to a **Web Worker** to keep the UI responsive and improve overall user experience.

5. **Error Boundaries**:
   - Enhanced application resilience by handling runtime errors gracefully, ensuring the rest of the app remains functional.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Web Workers**: For performing resource-intensive tasks in the background.
- **React Virtualized**: For efficient rendering of long lists.
- **React Error Boundaries**: To catch and recover from errors.
- **React Suspense**: For lazy loading components and improving perceived performance.
- **React.memo / useMemo / useCallback**: For optimizing rendering and computation.
